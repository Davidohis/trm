# Techie Relationship Management

The **Techie Relationship Management (TRM)** project at [TechLabs](https://techlabs.org) provides a data platform to store & analyze all information we have about our Techies (participants). We want to know **who they are** and **how they're doing** throughout their journey to become a Digital Shaper.

This project aims to provide a **standardized platform** across TechLabs locations. It **integrates** with existing tools within the TechLabs organization, such as TypeForm, GSuite, and Slack. The **TRM Dashboard** is a web application for the local journey teams to view, edit, and analyze the data for their Techies to get actionable insights for improving the TechLabs experience.

## Resources

- [Techie Relationship Management page on Notion](https://www.notion.so/techlabs/Techie-Relationship-Management-0b51be902d724043b756e1a32cca24c4) – used for scope & project planning, to-dos, and meeting notes
- [Slack Channel](https://techlabs-mgmt.slack.com/archives/C017RB4P0PL) on the TechLabs MGMT Slack workspace

## Architecture

![TRM project architecture](doc/architecture.svg)

As for the main components, we have Hasura, the TRM Dashboard, and some [serverless functions](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-serverless-architecture) for integrating external providers.

- The [Hasura GraphQL engine](https://hasura.io/) provides a GraphQL API used by the TRM dashboard and provider integrations.
- The TRM Dashboard is a React single-page web application (SPA) based on the [_react-admin_](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/) framework. See [`/frontend/`](frontend/) for the dashboard source code.
- The serverless functions in [`/functions/`](/functions/) integrate the TRM project with external providers, such as for authentification with Google, retrieving form responses from TypeForm, and fetching activity data from edyoucated & Slack.
- PostgreSQL is used for data storage & retrieval

## Deployment

The project is deployed on [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/). The infrastructure (see [`/infrastructure/`](/infrastructure/)) is managed with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) in two projects:

- [`/infrastructure/common`](/infrastructure/common) for all shared resources between environments: the Cloud SQL PostgreSQL database and a Google Artifact Registry Repository
- [`/infrastructure/app`](/infrastructure/app) provides resources for a specific environment: the Hasura instance as a [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) service, and the serverless functions in [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions)

The TRM Dashbaord is deployed on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/):

- [`TechLabs-Berlin/trm-frontend-staging`](github.com/TechLabs-Berlin/trm-frontend-staging) – for the _staging_ environment 

The deployment process runs the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) [`deploy` workflow](/.github/workflows/deploy.yml)  for every push to the deployment branches:

- `staging` branch for the _staging_ environment
